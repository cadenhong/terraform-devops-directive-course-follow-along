Using the main.tf file in this directory to call on all modules created in../webapp-module directory

Refer to the module block in main.tf calling the local module folder:

  module "webapp1" {
    source = "../webapp-module"
  }

* Note that there's no terraform.tfvars file *
Instead, the variables are defined inside the module block.
This can be useful if weare creating the same set of resources via module but need to specify slightly different variables;
For example, creating resources of a module twice - once for production env and once for development env
This will essentially replicate the same infrastructure and provision same resources but can now be used for different environments.
