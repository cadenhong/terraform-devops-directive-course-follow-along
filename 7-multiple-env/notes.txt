Managing Multiple Environments
1. Workspaces - multiple named sections within a single backend; similar to Git branches
    > Pros:
        - easy to get started
        - convenient terraform.workspace expression
        - minimizes code duplication
    > Cons: 
        - prone to human error
        - state stored within same backend (difficult to isolate permissioning - if someone has access to dev, they also have access to prod)
        - codebase doesn't ambiguously show deployment configurations; hard to tell what's deployed where
2. File Structure - directory layout that provides separation and modules that provides reuses
    > Pros:
        - isolation of backend (improved security, decrease for human error)
        - codebase fully represents deployed state
    > Cons:
        - multiple `terraform apply` required to provision environments
        - more code duplication
            - *** this can be minimized with modules ***
